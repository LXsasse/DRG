This directory contains code to create a simulated dataset for testing your models. 

- <filename> for a model on a reference genome and one condition
- <filename> for multiple conditions (cell types) that partially share regulatory elements and therefore could help with feature extraction. 
- <filename> across different individuals with genomic variation, that sometimes change and sometimes don't change regulartory motifs. 

TODO
- [ ] clean and finish simulation scripts
- [ ] return multiple data modalities for same simulated genome for multi-modality training
- [ ] Include RNA structure simulation and long distance folding
