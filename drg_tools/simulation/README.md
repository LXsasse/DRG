This directory contains code to create a simulated dataset for testing your models. One for a model on a reference genome and one condition, one for multiple conditions (cell types) that partially share regulatory elements and therefore could help with feature extraction. And lastly across different individuals with genomic variation, that sometimes change and sometimes don't change regulartory motifs.
