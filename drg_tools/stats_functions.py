def correlation2pvalue(r, n):
    
    '''
    
    Under the assumption that x and y are drawn from
    independent normal distributions (so the population correlation coefficient is 0), the probability density function of the sample correlation
    coefficient r is ([1]_, [2]_):
    .. math::
    
    f(r) = "\frac{{(1-r^2)}^{n/2-2}}{\athrm{B}(\frac{1}{2},\frac{n}{2}-1)}"
    
    where n is the number of samples, and B is the beta function.  This
    is sometimes referred to as the exact distribution of r.  This is
    the distribution that is used in `pearsonr` to compute the p-value.
    The distribution is a beta distribution on the interval [-1, 1],
    with equal shape parameters a = b = n/2 - 1.  In terms of SciPy's
    implementation of the beta distribution, the distribution of r is::
        dist = scipy.stats.beta(n/2 - 1, n/2 - 1, loc=-1, scale=2)
    The p-value returned by `pearsonr` is a two-sided p-value. The p-value
    roughly indicates the probability of an uncorrelated system
    producing datasets that have a Pearson correlation at least as extreme
    as the one computed from these datasets. More precisely, for a
    given sample with correlation coefficient r, the p-value is
    the probability that abs(r') of a random sample x' and y' drawn from
    the population with zero correlation would be greater than or equal
    to abs(r). In terms of the object ``dist`` shown above, the p-value
    for a given r and length n can be computed as::
        p = 2*dist.cdf(-abs(r))
    When n is 2, the above continuous distribution is not well-defined.
    One can interpret the limit of the beta distribution as the shape
    parameters a and b approach a = b = 0 as a discrete distribution with
    equal probability masses at r = 1 and r = -1.  More directly, one
    can observe that, given the data x = [x1, x2] and y = [y1, y2], and
    assuming x1 != x2 and y1 != y2, the only possible values for r are 1
    and -1.  Because abs(r') for any sample x' and y' with length 2 will
    be 1, the two-sided p-value for a sample of length 2 is always 1.
    
    '''
    
    # As explained in the docstring, the p-value can be computed as

    # a = b = n/2 - 1.  `special.btdtr` is the CDF for the beta distribution
    # on [0, 1].  To use it, we make the transformation  x = (r + 1)/2; the
    # shape parameters do not change.  Then -abs(r) used in `cdf(-abs(r))`
    # becomes x = (-abs(r) + 1)/2 = 0.5*(1 - abs(r)).  (r is cast to float64
    # to avoid a TypeError raised by btdtr when r is higher precision.)
